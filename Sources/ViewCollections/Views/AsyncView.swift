/// An async view that only presents the content if the content is loaded.
///
/// > Example:
/// >
/// > Present the value on completion of `await`ed result generator.
/// >
/// > ```swift
/// > AsyncView {
/// >     // value: () async throws -> String
/// > } content: { result in
/// >     Text(result)
/// > }
/// > ```
///
/// ## Dealing with states
///
/// A typical use of this view is to create a `@State` based on the result of `resultGenerator`. However, SwiftUI would not like that. A workaround would be adding an `id` to the `AsyncView` with the identifier as an indication that the `View` should be reset.
///
/// ```swift
/// AsyncView {
///     try fetchData()
/// } content: { results, data in
///     ParagraphView(results: results, receivedData: receivedData, data: data)
/// }
/// .id(receivedData.id)
/// ```
///
/// In this example, `data` is passed to `ParagraphView` as an `@State` property. Such property is reset when the `receivedData.id` changes.
///
/// The `state`'s initial value can only be set once; there after, setting it in init has not effect, which is why an `id(_:)` is required.
///
/// - experiment: For some reason, however, the `data` is linked with the `id`, meaning that the `data` is preserved for each `id`.
///
/// - note: Open an unstructured `Task` only when something makes sense to execute *concurrently* to the `View`'s normal operation, like refreshing the model, not `buttonTapped()` callbacks.
///
/// - Tip: Initialize the `_state` using `State.init(wrappedValue:)`.
///
/// > Note:
/// > It is also possible to pass an `@Observable` object. Declare the `data` as a constant in the child view, then inside the `body`, declare:
/// > ```swift
/// > @Bindable var data = data
/// > ```
